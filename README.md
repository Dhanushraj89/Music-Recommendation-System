Music Recommendation System<br>

The Music Recommendation System is a sophisticated web-based application designed to forecast music popularity and provide personalized song recommendations based on user preferences. It leverages an enhanced Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network model to analyze a comprehensive dataset from Spotify, encompassing both textual (genre) and numerical (audio characteristics) data. This system offers users an engaging and interactive music discovery experience, contributing to the dynamic landscape of music streaming services.<br>

Description:<br>
The Music Recommendation System utilizes advanced machine learning algorithms and data analytics techniques to predict song popularity and offer tailored recommendations. By combining textual and numerical information extracted from the Spotify dataset, the system can generate precise predictions and suggest tracks that align with users' tastes and preferences.<br>

Features:<br>
- Prediction of Song Popularity: The system forecasts the popularity of songs using LSTM neural network models trained on a broad dataset from Spotify.<br>
- Personalized Recommendations: Users receive personalized song recommendations based on their listening history, preferences, and the characteristics of songs they enjoy.<br>
- Real-Time Updates: The system provides real-time updates on newly released tracks, trending songs, and personalized recommendations to enhance the user experience.<br>
- Integration with Music Streaming Platforms: Integration with popular music streaming platforms allows users to listen to recommended tracks directly within the application.<br>
- User Interaction: Users can provide feedback and ratings on recommended songs, enabling the system to adjust recommendations based on user preferences.<br>

Technologies Used:<br>
- Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Neural Network: LSTM neural networks are used to analyze song data and generate predictions based on both textual and numerical features.<br>
- Python: The application is developed using Python programming language, leveraging libraries such as TensorFlow, pandas, and scikit-learn for data processing and model training.<br>
- Jupyter Notebook: The .ipynb file contains the code for training the LSTM model and generating predictions. It allows users to run each cell individually and observe the results.<br>
- GitHub: The project is hosted on GitHub, providing version control and collaboration features for the development team.<br>

Getting Started:<br>
- To run the Music Recommendation System using the provided .ipynb file, follow these steps:<br>
- Clone the repository to your local machine.<br>
- Open the .ipynb file using Jupyter Notebook or Visual Studio Code.<br>
- Run each cell in the notebook sequentially by pressing Shift+Enter.<br>
- Make sure to install the necessary Python libraries specified in the notebook using pip install.<br>
- Follow the instructions provided in the notebook for data preprocessing, model training, and prediction generation.<br>

Future Enhancements:<br>
- Integration of real-time user feedback and ratings to further personalize recommendations.<br>
- Enhancement of model training techniques to adapt to evolving music trends and user preferences.<br>
- Evaluation of the model's effectiveness on different datasets to ensure generalization across various musical settings.<br>
